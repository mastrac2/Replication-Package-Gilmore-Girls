# Replication-Package-Gilmore-Girls
## **Instructions**
In order to access and use the script, open the file entitled "final_project_script.R" which contains the data I collected. In order to access my dataset, open the "raw data - Sheet1.csv" file. 

## **Data**
The data I used was found by gathering every Gilmore Girls episode from season 1 and season 7. The question that was being asked was what makes certain episodes more enjoyable or entertaining than others. I looked to see how the amount of characters in the episodes affected this, along with the humor and emotional value of each episode. Each unit of analysis was one episode and 43 total observations were collected. The type of sampling strategy used was convenience sampling. 

I gathered the data by taking all of the episodes from season 1 and analyzing the humor, amount of characters, enjoyment, and emotionalness of each episode Then, I repeated the same process with all of the episodes from season 7. 

## **Operationalization** ##
The concept of the humor of each episode was operationalized through a qualitative ranking scheme that included rankings of low, medium, and high humor. If I didn't find an episode too humorous it would be scored with low, if it was somewhat humorous it was paired with a medium, and if it was very humorous it was paired with a high. 

The concept of enjoyment of each episode was operationalized through a quantitative ranking system. With this system, I ranked my enjoyment of each of the analyzed episodes on a scale of 1-100. Episodes that I most enjoyed would get scores nearer to 100 and ones I did not enjoy as much were nearer to 0. 

The concept of main characters in each episode was operationalized through a quantitative system. I counted how many of the main characters were featured in each episode and used the amount of main characters as the quantitative variable. 

The concept of emotionalness of each episode was operationalized though a qualitative system in which I ranked each episode on a scale of not emotional, emotional, and very emotional. If an episode was more emotional it would be ranked as very emotional and so on.
